# Crime-Hostpot-Clustering-and-Analysis
Crime hotspot clustering and analysis for the city of Vancouver, Indian States and Maharashtra Districts with a dynamic interactive dashboard.

The added four notebooks cluster differnt locations for their crime hotspots broadly into three crime-rate categories (High, Medium, Low) basis multiple crimes committed.

The different clustering algorithms employed to are:
1. k-means clustering
2. Heirarchical clustering
3. Fuccy c-mean clustering

The results were visualized using maps, and the analysis was supported with an interactive dashboard that would allow users to select desired locations and see them categorized as per their crime rate in action.

Refer to such analysis for the city of Vancouver below:
